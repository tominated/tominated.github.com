I"å<p>Just last night, I finished an assignment using Adobe After Effects where we had to create almost any sort of video, as long as we used AE.
This was my submission. It is basically a promotional video to advertise my skills. Most of the graphic design work (apart from Brainchild)
has been for assignments. Do note that I donâ€™t actually do animation, so the bit at the start was just to fill in time (it had to go from 1
to 2 minutes long).</p>

<p>Let me know what you think!</p>
