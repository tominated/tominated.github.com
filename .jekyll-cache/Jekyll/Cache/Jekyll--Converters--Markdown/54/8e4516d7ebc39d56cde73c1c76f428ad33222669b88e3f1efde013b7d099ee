I"¥<p>I thought I would post a (long overdue) update on my employment situation.</p>

<p>Back in late July (I thinkâ€¦), my old employer, DMDN, could not pay use due to our major client bringing us with them when they went out of business. DMDN was a fantastic company with an exceptional team, which I will try as best as I can to keep in contact with. I learnt so much that I wouldnâ€™t have even tried if I continued to freelance. The company breaking up obviously left me in a bit of a slump as I was processing it as best as an 18 year old could.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I had a friend working at Black Milk Clothing as a web developer (with only one other dev to help) and as such, they were looking for developers. Although they used PHP, which I very rarely use unless I have to (I am not a fan of the langauge), they promptly hired me after I sent my details through in early September.</p>

<p>I have had a great time at Black Milk and have already made my mark on the site. Technically all the developers (all 3 of us :P) are employed as IT guys, so we pretty much have control over any tech stuff in the company, which is great. It also means that we can approach problems however we feel. Ive already finished a small project using Ruby, Sinatra and Backbone.js, and Iâ€™m currently working on something using Clojure (which is a lot of fun, I might add).</p>

<p>I look forward to a lot of fun projects in the future with Black Milk!</p>
