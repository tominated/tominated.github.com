I"V<p>After realising that Tumblr has really gotten popular recently, I’ve decided
to make a tumblr theme. I got a tumblog back when tumblr was in it’s infancy
and just never used it. I’m currently finishing up the theme and still have
to test it in browsers other than Chrome and Firefox (yay…). I’m still on the
fence on whether I should sell it or not (Uni life isn’t kind to my
wallet—some money to spend on lunch would be nice). If I do, I’d sell it for
$AUD15 on my website here. You can view the theme as I build and test it
<a href="http://tominated.tumblr.com/">here</a>.</p>
