I"5<p>I decided not too long ago that I would try and help out my mum and learn some
new skills by making a (primarily client-side) web app to handle finances for
vending machine companies or owners. I am calling it <em>Vendotron</em> and it is
made using the standard HTML5 and CSS3 graphical goodies, along with
backbone.js (and require.js) to power it. I havenâ€™t done much javascript apart
from some jQuery here and there to spice up pages, so it has been interesting
so far.</p>

<p>As you can see in the picture above, I have already got a nice design down. I
have also implemented adding vending machines to your inventory, but the rest
is still in progress (also, there is no persistence yet). It is completely
open source, but I will probably charge for use of it on my servers (standard
SaaS deal).</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://tominated.github.com/Vendotron">see what I have in action</a> and
<a href="http://github.com/tominated/Vendotron">check out the source</a>. Let me know if
you have any suggestions (design or code wise), or if you want to help me out!</p>
