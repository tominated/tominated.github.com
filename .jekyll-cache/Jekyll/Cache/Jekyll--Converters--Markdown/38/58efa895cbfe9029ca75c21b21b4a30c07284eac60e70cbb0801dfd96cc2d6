I"­<p>I finally finished all of my uni assignments for the semester this week. One
assignment I am particularly happy about is a design proposal and prototype I
had to create for an iPad magazine for the QUT fashion studentâ€™s magazine;
Frock Paper Scissors.</p>

<p>Instead of submitting the proposal as a plain old printed document, I decided
to create a small single page website. Using images from the Frock Paper
Scissors website, I managed to make a pretty good looking site. The content
isnâ€™t awesome (like most uni students, I left it until the last minute), but I
am really happy with the design.</p>

<p><a href="http://clients.tombrunoli.com/kib109/">You can view it here</a>.
Do note that it is REALLY unoptimised and uses absolutely
massive images, so It will take a while to load. Wait until itâ€™s finished
loading before scrolling for the best experience. Let me know what you think!</p>

<p>Also, you can

This will only work on webkit browsers as far as I know. It works pretty great
on an iPad, as intended. It also only works in landscape mode.</p>
