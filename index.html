      <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Tom and I&rsquo;m a professional software engineer.</p>

      <p>
        I love to build rich web and mobile apps, and software with a focus on user experience, quality, &amp;
        maintainability.
        I&rsquo;ve worked as a professional software engineer since 2012, and have experience with many patterns,
        languages, tools &amp; systems.
      </p>

        At Spotify in New York, I built a seamless webview experience for like-native marketing
        campaigns within the iOS client (used for Spotify
        Wrapped 2023, and <a
          href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-10-18/spotifys-interactive-experiences-create-the-magic-of-wrapped-year-round/"
          target="_blank">many marketing campaigns</a>), the

        internal tooling for non-technical staff, data pipelines and more.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Black Milk Clothing in Brisbane Australia, I built a faceted-search interface using React &amp; Elasticsearch
        that integrated with their Shopify storefront. I also worked a social media image scraper for Black Milk
        Clothing&rsquo;s products, and a Shopify-integrated order management, inventory management &amp; reporting
        system.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my own time I like to work with functional programming, type systems, 3D graphics, emulation, and more.
        I&rsquo;m a huge music enthusiast and you&rsquo;ll likely find me at a concert every week or so.
        I also love film &amp; digital photography.
