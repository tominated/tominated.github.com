    I like to develop websites, web applications and other hobby projects.
    I specialize in modern front and back end web development techniques,
    including Javascript frameworks such as
    <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React.js</a>
    and <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a> as well as back end
    frameworks such as
    <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> with
    SQL databases, such as MySQL and Postgres, and schemaless databases,
    such as Redis and Elasticsearch. 
    I also love teaching myself new things and have worked on hobby projects
    in many areas of software, like 3D graphics, CPU emulation and iOS apps,
    using the Clojure, Haskell and Swift programming languages, among others.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have been working as a freelance web developer since 2010, and began
    working full time in a professional environment in 2012. In 2015 I
    completed a Bachelor of Information Technology with distinction at QUT,
    Australia.
  </p>
  <p>
    I currently work as a full time web developer for
    <a href="http://blackmilkclothing.com/" target="_blank">Black Milk Clothing</a>,
    working on the back end implementation of many of the supplimentary
    website features, such as order management, wishlists, product restock
    transactional emailing and internal reporting. I also work on some
    front end features such as the
    <a href="http://blackmilkclothing.com/pages/search" target="_blank">faceted search interface</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I am working full time, I am currently not taking on any more projects.
