I finally finished all of my uni assignments for the semester this week. One
assignment I am particularly happy about is a design proposal and prototype I
had to create for an iPad magazine for the QUT fashion student's magazine;
Frock Paper Scissors.

Instead of submitting the proposal as a plain old printed document, I decided
to create a small single page website. Using images from the Frock Paper
Scissors website, I managed to make a pretty good looking site. The content
isnâ€™t awesome (like most uni students, I left it until the last minute), but I
am really happy with the design.

[You can view it here](http://clients.tombrunoli.com/kib109/).
Do note that it is REALLY unoptimised and uses absolutely
massive images, so It will take a while to load. Wait until it's finished
loading before scrolling for the best experience. Let me know what you think!
