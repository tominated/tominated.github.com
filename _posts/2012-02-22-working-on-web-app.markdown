I decided not too long ago that I would try and help out my mum and learn some
new skills by making a (primarily client-side) web app to handle finances for
vending machine companies or owners. I am calling it _Vendotron_ and it is
made using the standard HTML5 and CSS3 graphical goodies, along with
backbone.js (and require.js) to power it. I haven't done much javascript apart
from some jQuery here and there to spice up pages, so it has been interesting
so far.

As you can see in the picture above, I have already got a nice design down. I
have also implemented adding vending machines to your inventory, but the rest
is still in progress (also, there is no persistence yet). It is completely
open source, but I will probably charge for use of it on my servers (standard
SaaS deal).

You can [see what I have in action](http://tominated.github.com/Vendotron) and
[check out the source](http://github.com/tominated/Vendotron). Let me know if
you have any suggestions (design or code wise), or if you want to help me out!
