So I finally got around to re-designing my website, with a focus on content,
and not the layout itself. You may notice that it is responsive, so it looks
good on pretty much any sized device. You'll also notice that on each page,
I now have a [last.fm](http://last.fm/) widget on the bottom of each page, so
you can see what I've been listening to recently.

I drew a lot of inspiration from
[Elliot Jay Stocks](http://elliotjaystocks.com/) new website, which is very
minimalist and uses the same font size for everything (which I have done on
this site). If there is anything you would like to see added to my site, or
if you want to contact me for any other reason, just fill out my
[contact form](/contact.html).

Let me know what you think!
