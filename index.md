Hi, I'm Tom and I'm a professional software engineer.

I love to build web apps, mobile apps and other software with a focus on user experience, quality, & maintainability, with the languages and tools that suit the problem space best.
I've worked as a professional software engineer since 2012, and have experience with many patterns, languages, tools & systems.

In my own time I like to work with functional programming, type systems, 3D graphics, emulation, and more. I'm a big fan of the OCaml programming language.

At Spotify in New York, I built the Stations Web Player (including its sunset experience), a seamless webview experience for like-native marketing campaigns within the iOS client, internal tooling for non-technical staff, data pipelines and more.

At Black Milk Clothing in Brisbane Australia, I built a faceted-search interface using React & Elasticsearch that integrated with their Shopify storefront system to scrape and display social images featuring Black Milk Clothing's products (long before commercial availability), the  order and inventory management systems and reporting integrated with Shopify, and more.

I am not currently looking for a new role.
