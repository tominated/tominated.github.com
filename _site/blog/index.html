    <h2><a href="/blog/News/2011/10/22/promo-video/">Promotional video I made for an assignment</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 22 October 2011</h3>
  </header>
  <p>Just last night, I finished an assignment using Adobe After Effects where we had to create almost any sort of video, as long as we used AE.
This was my submission. It is basically a promotional video to advertise my skills. Most of the graphic design work (apart from Brainchild)
has been for assignments. Do note that I don't actually do animation, so the bit at the start was just to fill in time (it had to go from 1
to 2 minutes long).</p>

<p>Let me know what you think!</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/News/2011/10/12/new-site/">Another Day, Another Site&hellip;</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 12 October 2011</h3>
  </header>
  <p>So I finally got around to re-designing my website, with a focus on content,
and not the layout itself. You may notice that it is responsive, so it looks
good on pretty much any sized device. You'll also notice that on each page,
I now have a <a href="http://last.fm/">last.fm</a> widget on the bottom of each page, so
you can see what I've been listening to recently.</p>

<p>I drew a lot of inspiration from
<a href="http://elliotjaystocks.com/">Elliot Jay Stocks</a> new website, which is very
minimalist and uses the same font size for everything (which I have done on
this site). If there is anything you would like to see added to my site, or
if you want to contact me for any other reason, just fill out my
<a href="/contact.html">contact form</a>.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think!</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/Code/2011/05/12/experimenting-with-css-reset/">Experimenting with my own CSS Reset</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 12 May 2011</h3>
  </header>
  <p>Just out of boredom today, I decided to make a sort of CSS reset for
myself. Technically it's more base styles than a reset seeing as it
has a lot of styling rather than just removing margins and padding.</p>

<p>I haven't really tested it (OK, so not at all tested it), but I thought
other people may like it. Here it is in it's uncompressed glory:</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I have tested it in Webkit and Gecko (chrome and firefox) and
it works beautifully. I have also made a preview page. You can check it out
<a href="/reset_test.html"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `join' for #&lt;String:0x007fab2a35bec0></p>

<p>You can download a minified version <a href="/downloads/reset.min.css">here</a>. It's licensed under
the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribute-ShareAlike</a> licence.</p>

<p>Hopefully someone else can make use of it. I'd love to know if you do use it, so just submit a
comment (if disqus decides to work), or send me an email!</p>

    <h2><a href="/blog/News/2011/03/30/tumblr-theme/">So I'm building a Tumblr theme…</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 30 March 2011</h3>
  </header>
  <p>After realising that Tumblr has really gotten popular recently, I've decided
to make a tumblr theme. I got a tumblog back when tumblr was in it's infancy
and just never used it. I'm currently finishing up the theme and still have
to test it in browsers other than Chrome and Firefox (yay…). I'm still on the
fence on whether I should sell it or not (Uni life isn't kind to my
wallet—some money to spend on lunch would be nice). If I do, I'd sell it for
$AUD15 on my website here. You can view the theme as I build and test it
<a href="http://tominated.tumblr.com/">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Posted on 13 March 2011</h3>

  <p>In it's current state, my website is virtually finished. I'm sure
to change things as time passes, either gradually improving, or
completely revamping the site.</p>

<p>I hope everyone likes it as it is! Let me know what you think
(once comments are working of course).</p>

  <p>Hey there! I've finally decided to upload my portfolio for
the world to see! You'll probably notice that this site isn't
quite complete, but I decided to upload it on a whim.</p>

<p>At the moment, I am not available for work—I just started
university, so I'm a little bogged down, but as soon as I
am available, I will post on my blog.</p>
