    <h2><a href="/blog/News/2012/06/09/uni-assignment-design-proposal/">Uni Assignment Design Proposal</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 09 June 2012</h3>
  </header>
  I finally finished all of my uni assignments for the semester this week. One
assignment I am particularly happy about is a design proposal and prototype I
had to create for an iPad magazine for the QUT fashion student's magazine;
Frock Paper Scissors.

Instead of submitting the proposal as a plain old printed document, I decided
to create a small single page website. Using images from the Frock Paper
Scissors website, I managed to make a pretty good looking site. The content
isn’t awesome (like most uni students, I left it until the last minute), but I
am really happy with the design.

[You can view it here](http://clients.tombrunoli.com/kib109/).
Do note that it is REALLY unoptimised and uses absolutely
massive images, so It will take a while to load. Wait until it's finished
loading before scrolling for the best experience. Let me know what you think!

    <h2><a href="/blog/News/2012/02/22/working-on-web-app/">Web App that I am Working On</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 22 February 2012</h3>
  </header>
  I decided not too long ago that I would try and help out my mum and learn some
new skills by making a (primarily client-side) web app to handle finances for
vending machine companies or owners. I am calling it _Vendotron_ and it is
made using the standard HTML5 and CSS3 graphical goodies, along with
backbone.js (and require.js) to power it. I haven't done much javascript apart
from some jQuery here and there to spice up pages, so it has been interesting
so far.

As you can see in the picture above, I have already got a nice design down. I
have also implemented adding vending machines to your inventory, but the rest
is still in progress (also, there is no persistence yet). It is completely
open source, but I will probably charge for use of it on my servers (standard
SaaS deal).

You can [see what I have in action](http://tominated.github.com/Vendotron) and
[check out the source](http://github.com/tominated/Vendotron). Let me know if
you have any suggestions (design or code wise), or if you want to help me out!

    <h2><a href="/blog/News/2011/10/22/promo-video/">Promotional video I made for an assignment</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 22 October 2011</h3>
  </header>
  Just last night, I finished an assignment using Adobe After Effects where we had to create almost any sort of video, as long as we used AE.
This was my submission. It is basically a promotional video to advertise my skills. Most of the graphic design work (apart from Brainchild)
has been for assignments. Do note that I don't actually do animation, so the bit at the start was just to fill in time (it had to go from 1
to 2 minutes long).

Let me know what you think!

    <h3>Posted on 12 October 2011</h3>
  </header>
  So I finally got around to re-designing my website, with a focus on content,
and not the layout itself. You may notice that it is responsive, so it looks
good on pretty much any sized device. You'll also notice that on each page,
I now have a [last.fm](http://last.fm/) widget on the bottom of each page, so
you can see what I've been listening to recently.

I drew a lot of inspiration from
[Elliot Jay Stocks](http://elliotjaystocks.com/) new website, which is very
minimalist and uses the same font size for everything (which I have done on
this site). If there is anything you would like to see added to my site, or
if you want to contact me for any other reason, just fill out my
[contact form](/contact.html).

Let me know what you think!

    <h2><a href="/blog/News/2011/03/30/tumblr-theme/">So I'm building a Tumblr theme…</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on 30 March 2011</h3>
  </header>
  After realising that Tumblr has really gotten popular recently, I've decided
to make a tumblr theme. I got a tumblog back when tumblr was in it's infancy
and just never used it. I'm currently finishing up the theme and still have
to test it in browsers other than Chrome and Firefox (yay…). I'm still on the
fence on whether I should sell it or not (Uni life isn't kind to my
wallet—some money to spend on lunch would be nice). If I do, I'd sell it for
$AUD15 on my website here. You can view the theme as I build and test it
[here](http://tominated.tumblr.com/).

    <h3>Posted on 13 March 2011</h3>

  In it's current state, my website is virtually finished. I'm sure
to change things as time passes, either gradually improving, or
completely revamping the site.

I hope everyone likes it as it is! Let me know what you think
(once comments are working of course).

  Hey there! I've finally decided to upload my portfolio for
the world to see! You'll probably notice that this site isn't
quite complete, but I decided to upload it on a whim.

At the moment, I am not available for work—I just started
university, so I'm a little bogged down, but as soon as I
am available, I will post on my blog.
