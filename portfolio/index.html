  <p>
    I designed and developed the <em>Aspley 10 Pin Bowl</em> website using the
    static site generator, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>
    in collaboration with
    <a href="http://mylestone.net.au" target="_blank">Alexander Brabyn</a>. I
    was responsible for all design and development, while Alexander wrote content.

  <p>
    I developed the <em>Davinda Innovations</em> website using a custom back-end
    built with <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" target="_blank">Sinatra</a>
    to allow for easy editing and to facilitate pre-orders of their up-coming
    product, the <em>Shower Shortener</em>.

  </a>
  <p>
    I designed the <em>Brainchild Foundation</em> website to allow for the new charity
    to easily spread news and help families in need. The website runs on a
    <a href="http://drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a> back end, with a custom
    designed front end theme.

  <img src="/img/portfolio/preview/gracey.jpg" alt="Chris Gracey" class="img">
  <p>
    I was approached by Chris Gracey to design and develop an online resume
    to easier promote himself. The site was developed with static HTML and CSS,
    and utilised non-refreshing page transitions (using AJAX). The site is now
    offline as per the client's request.

    <h2>Scotmac Constructions</h2>

  </a>
  <p>
    I was requested to design Scotmac Constructions a website based of their
    new business card. I developed the site to utilise
    <a href="http://www.couchcms.com/">Couch CMS</a> so the client could
    easily edit the site content.
